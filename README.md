The AnalysingDDoS.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contains the calculations referenced in Chapter 4 Results. This can also be viewed in the corresponding PDP with the same name.

TestingFilter.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook where some metrics were tested for counter measures, as described in Chapter 5. This file tests on post-mortem files from the CIC DDoS2019 Dataset.

To test the metrics on live stream the scapysend.py file was used, in combination with detect_aaf, detect_freq, detect_lowdeltatime, detect_packetsize.py
